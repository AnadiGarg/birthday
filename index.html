This letter might get a little long, so please read it only if you have the time 🙃<br>
It’s been years since I expressed something like this, so I wanted to say it honestly.<br><br>

Nowadays, we rarely tell people what they mean to us. Everyone is busy with studies, work, and life.
So this is just my small attempt to make you feel special — even if it’s only for a moment ☺️✨<br><br>

Once you healed me, I realised how amazing you truly are.
You are beautiful, kind, mature, and honestly, I’ve never met someone like you at this age.
You are perfect in everything that you are 🙇🏻‍♂️🌼<br><br>

Your inner and mental beauty is far greater than your outer beauty.
The way you think, understand life, and handle things makes you very special from within 🫶🏻🤍<br><br>

I admire the way you deal with life.
A lot has happened in your life — things much deeper than what I’ve experienced —
yet you came out of it with clarity and strength.
That says a lot about who you are.
You are a great personality, even if many people don’t fully understand you 🥲✨<br><br>

I want you to know that I still feel the same admiration and respect for you that I did 2.5 years ago.
This is not a concern, and you don’t need to worry about it at all.
Just leave it with me 🤓🌱<br><br>

You have played a very big role in shaping the way I think,
the way I see life, and the way I do things.
Wherever I am today, mentally and physically,
you hold a big credit for that.
I’ve learned things from you that nobody else could ever teach me 😌📖<br><br>

I also know that I probably don’t hold even 0.1% of a place in your life.
I’m aware of that.
Still, you are very special to me,
and that truth won’t change 🧐💭<br><br>

I loved talking to you, and I still feel nervous sometimes —
not out of fear, but because I see you as someone very intelligent,
kind, creative, and above me in many ways 😎✨<br><br>

You are the greatest poet I’ve ever seen.
The depth and honesty in your words reaches places that are hard to explain.
No matter how much I write about you, it will always feel less.
Like Alexander the Great — you are the great Mihika 😜📜<br><br>

I know we don’t talk much.
Sometimes it’s just a reel and a reply.
Still, you hold a big place in my mind
and a small, honest place in my heart 😝💗<br><br>

I know you’re preparing for JEE.
I truly believe you will do great in life —
not just in exams, but in whatever you choose.
You are far bigger than any result 😊🌟<br><br>

One more thing — please take this as a very, very, very big joke —
I once thought about travelling with you 😝✈️
Nothing serious, nothing deep, just a thought.<br><br>

If you receive any gift today, please don’t say no.
I’ve never really had the chance to do something for you.
It might not mean much to you,
but it means a lot to me 🎁🤍<br><br>

Wishing you a very special and happiest birthday 🎂✨<br><br>

— someone who truly admires you
